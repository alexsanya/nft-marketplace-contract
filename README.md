## NFT Marketplace contract

**Run on-chain auction and sell NFT for ERC-20 via meta-transactions**

The auctions should work as follows:


- Owner of the NFT approves all NFTâ€™s to the Marketplace
- Owner of the NFT signs to create an off-chain auction listing with a minimum price
-  Bidder approves ERC20 tokens to Marketplace
- Bidder signs a bid for the auction
-  If owner approves the bid, signs it back and retrieve to bidder
-   Anyone with both signatures can settle the transaction, the owner takes the ERC20 whilst the bidder takes the NFT.
